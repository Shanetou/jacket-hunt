I had a problem, albeit a first-world one. I wanted a jacked--a very specific one--and I only wanted a used one. But poor little me, I was tired of manually checking the Patagonia used gear site for new stock. This little scraper plunders the Patagonia page for available jackets and then emails me the results.
